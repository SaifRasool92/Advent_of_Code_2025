**Day 5 Highlights: Cafeteria**

• Forklifts break through a wall and reveal the hidden cafeteria.
• Chaos in the kitchen because the new inventory management system is confusing the Elves.
• Fresh ingredients are defined by ID ranges, and IDs inside any range are considered fresh.
• Ranges can overlap, and any range that contains an ID marks it as fresh.
• You are given a list of ranges and a list of ingredient IDs to check.
• Task for Part One: count how many available ingredient IDs are fresh.
• Result for Part One: **513 fresh ingredients**.

**Part Two Highlights**

• Available ingredient list becomes irrelevant.
• You need to figure out how many total IDs are fresh across all ranges combined.
• All ranges are merged conceptually, including overlaps, to determine the full set of fresh IDs.
• Task: count every ID covered by any range.
• Result for Part Two: **339668510830757 total fresh IDs**.
