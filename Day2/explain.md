Here are the clean, sharp highlights you need:

**Part One Highlights**
• You receive several ID ranges.
• An ID is invalid if it consists of a sequence of digits repeated **exactly twice**
(examples: 11, 22, 6464, 123123).
• No leading zeroes allowed.
• You scan each range and collect every invalid ID.
• In the example, the invalid IDs sum to **1227775554**.
• Your final answer was **21139440284**.

**Part Two Highlights**
• Rule expands: an ID is invalid if a digit-sequence repeats **two or more times**
(examples: 1111111, 12341234, 1212121212).
• All IDs caught in Part One remain invalid.
• Additional IDs appear because of longer repetition patterns.
• Example sum becomes **4174379265**.
• Your final answer is whatever you computed for the extended rule set.
