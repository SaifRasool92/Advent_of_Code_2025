
# **Part 1 Highlights**

* You arrive in a huge cavern filled with Christmas trees.
* Elves are stressed because they must fit weirdly shaped presents under each tree.
* Every present shape is shown in a small grid of # and ., and each region under a tree has a size like 4x4 or 12x5.
* Your task is to check whether all required presents can fit into each region without overlapping.
* Presents can be rotated or flipped, but they must stay on the grid.
* You are given several regions and quantities of each shape to test.
* In the example:

  * The 4x4 region can fit two copies of shape 4.
  * The first 12x5 region can fit all required shapes.
  * The second 12x5 region cannot fit everything because it needs one extra shape 4.
* Final puzzle result: **443 regions successfully fit all required presents.**

# **Part 2 Highlights**

* The Elves thank you and start placing the arranged presents.
* More Elves arrive, each carrying a star for the Christmas trees.
* Suddenly, a large tree flashes and a star appears on top by magic.
* You think you saw Santa briefly in the crowd.
* You still need to collect **23 more stars** to continue.
