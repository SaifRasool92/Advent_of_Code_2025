• You enter a factory where machines are offline because their initialization procedure is missing.
• Each machine has indicator lights, and each button toggles certain lights.
• The goal is to figure out the minimum button presses needed to match each machine’s target light pattern.
• Joltage values in curly braces are ignored in this part.
• You solve each machine by finding the smallest combination of button presses that matches the required light configuration.
• Total minimum presses for all machines: **436**

**Part Two Highlights**
• Now the machines need their joltage counters set.
• Indicator lights are ignored and each button now increases specific counters by 1.
• Goal: reach exact target joltage values with the fewest button presses.
• This becomes a system of equations where you find the minimum press count to reach the exact counter targets.
• Total minimum presses for all machines: **33**
