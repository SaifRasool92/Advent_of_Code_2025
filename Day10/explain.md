# **Part One Highlights**
- You enter a factory where machines are offline because their initialization procedure is missing.
- Each machine has indicator lights, and each button toggles certain lights.
- The goal is to figure out the minimum button presses needed to match each machine’s target light pattern.
- Joltage values in curly braces are ignored in this part.
- You solve each machine by finding the smallest combination of button presses that matches the required light configuration.
- Total minimum presses for all machines: **436**

# **Part Two Highlights**
- Now the machines need their joltage counters set.
- Indicator lights are ignored and each button now increases specific counters by 1.
- Goal: reach exact target joltage values with the fewest button presses.
- This becomes a system of equations where you find the minimum press count to reach the exact counter targets.
- Total minimum presses for all machines: **33**
