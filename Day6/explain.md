**Day 6 Highlights: Trash Compactor**

• You accidentally fall into a garbage smasher while helping the Elves.
• A family of friendly cephalopods offers to help you escape, but they ask you to solve their math homework while you wait.
• The worksheet shows many vertical stacks of numbers. Each stack ends with either a plus or a multiply sign.
• Every vertical stack is one full problem, and empty columns separate problems.
• You ignore alignment and just read all numbers above an operator as a single group for that problem.

**Part One logic**

• Read each problem top to bottom: numbers → operator at the bottom.
• Perform the operation on all numbers in that column.
• Add all problem results to get one grand total.
• My final total for Part One was **5171061464548**.

**Part Two twist**

• Cephalopod math is actually written right-to-left.
• Now you read each problem **column by column** from rightmost to leftmost.
• Build numbers by reading digits from top to bottom of each vertical column.
• The operator at the bottom still decides whether to add or multiply the formed numbers.
• Solve all problems again and add the results for the new grand total.
