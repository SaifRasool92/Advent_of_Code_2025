# **Part One Highlights**

- You land in a movie theater with a big tile grid.
- Some tiles are red, and you’re given all their coordinates.
- You must choose **any two red tiles** as opposite corners of a rectangle.
- The rectangle can be any orientation as long as its sides are horizontal and vertical.
- The goal is to find **the largest possible rectangle area** you can form using two red tiles as opposite corners.
- In the example, the biggest rectangle has area **50**.
- For your actual input, the answer was **4,764,078,684**.

# **Part Two Highlights**
- Now there are **red and green tiles**.
- Every red tile connects to the next red tile in the list through green tiles along a straight path.
- These red and green tiles form a **closed loop**, and everything inside the loop is also green.
- Tiles outside the loop are neither red nor green.
- Your rectangle must still have **two red tiles as opposite corners**, but the entire interior of the rectangle must now be **only red or green**.
- This reduces the number of valid rectangles.
- In the example, the biggest valid rectangle has area **24**.
